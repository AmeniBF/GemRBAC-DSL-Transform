# GemRBAC-DSL-Transform
This project has been developed at the [SVV lab](http://www.svv.lu) of the [University of Luxembourg](http://wwwen.uni.lu) by [Ameni Ben Fadhel](http://wwwen.uni.lu/snt/people/ameni_ben_fadhel).

GemRBAC-DSL is a model transformation tool takes as input RBAC policies expressed in GemRBAC-DSL and produces asoutput the corresponding OCL constraints, and a set of refactoring operations. These operations will be applied to the GemRBAC+CTX instance at deploymenttime.


The GemRBAC-DSL model has been introduced in:
